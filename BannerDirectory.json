For nearly a year, she examined wrongful child abuse allegations leveled by a nationally-recognized child abuse expert that were later rejected by juries, court officials, law enforcement and other doctors. Wintrode's work has been cited in a class-action lawsuit against the doctor. One story featuring a man convicted of killing a child in his care prompted a federal public defender to investigate his chances for an appeal.\n\nWintrode earned a bachelor's of science in business administration from Bryant University in Rhode Island. After deciding to make a career switch, she pursued a graduate degree from the University of Maryland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Philip Merrill College of Journalism where she was named outstanding master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s student of the December 2020 cohort.",
